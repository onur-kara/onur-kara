Hello! I'm Onur Kara, a defence and international relations expert based in Brighton, United Kingdom. With a PhD in War Studies from King's College London, my career spans roles in academia, defence analysis, and international relations, blending academic rigour with practical industry insight.

Currently working as an Analyst at Shephard Defence Insight, I focus on C4I Systems. Most of my current time is devoted to an in-house SaaS project. I'm also passionate about teaching and research, having served in military and civilian organisations.

My expertise lies in data analysis, qualitative fieldwork and project management, with an increasing interest in business management. As a bilingual professional in English and Turkish, I bring a global perspective to my work.

On this GitHub page, you'll find my projects that intersect technology, defence, and international relations. I aim to make all repos public once they reach maturity. Feel free to connect with me or explore my work!
