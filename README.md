Hello! I'm Onur Kara, a defence and international relations expert based in Brighton, United Kingdom. With a PhD in War Studies from King's College London, my career spans roles in academia, defence analysis, and international relations, blending academic rigour with practical industry insight.

I am currently a Senior Advisor at Six Analytic, a commercial solutions team attached to IISS. Please note that this is my personal account.
I'm also passionate about teaching and research, having served in military and civilian organisations.

On this GitHub page, you'll find my projects that intersect technology, defence, and international relations. Feel free to connect with me or explore my work.
